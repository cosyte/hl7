/**
 * Derive the package's public export surface from a built `.d.ts` and compare it against the
 * committed inventory at `release/public-api.json`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `dist/index.d.ts` is what every consumer's editor and compiler reads, and it
 * is assembled by a bundler from a barrel: nothing in `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck` or the test
 * suite fails when an export leaves it, changes shape, or arrives unnoticed. A published type
 * surface that nobody wrote down cannot be certified stable, and "we did not mean to remove that"
 * is not recoverable once a version is on the registry. The inventory is the written-down surface;
 * this script is the thing that says the two still agree.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO, and why each refusal is the point:
 *
 *   1. IT NEVER SELF-HEALS. The default mode compares and reports; it does not write. A check that
 *      rewrites its own baseline on mismatch always passes and therefore measures nothing, which is
 *      the exact shape of the silent-green failure the other gates in this repo were built against.
 *      Updating the baseline is `--write`, a separate deliberate act whose diff a reviewer reads.
 *   2. IT NEVER REPORTS AN EMPTY SURFACE AS A MATCH. Declarations that are absent, empty, or that
 *      resolve to a module with no exports are a MISSING INPUT (exit 2), never "zero exports, which
 *      happens to differ from the inventory" and never "zero exports, which happens to match an
 *      empty inventory". `tsup` writes JS before declarations, so every build has a window where
 *      `dist/` holds no `.d.ts` at all; a gate that cannot say its own inputs were missing reports
 *      that window as a pass. `scripts/attw.mjs` carries the same net for the same reason.
 *   3. IT NAMES EVERY DIFFERENCE. Added, removed and changed exports are listed individually, with
 *      the before and after for a change, so the reviewer decides whether the change is intended
 *      rather than being told only that something moved.
 *
 * WHAT AN INVENTORY ENTRY RECORDS. One entry per exported name, sorted by name:
 *
 *   `name`     the exported name, as a consumer imports it.
 *   `kind`     class | function | variable | interface | type | namespace | enum.
 *   `type`     for a VALUE export, the printed type (a function's signature, a const's type). Empty
 *              for a type-only or namespace export, whose printed type is just its own name.
 *   `members`  the named parts of the export, SORTED for a stable diff:
 *                interface / class   its properties and methods, `name?: Type` when optional
 *                                    (a class also lists its static side, prefixed `static `)
 *                type alias          the constituents when it is a union (so a warning-code or
 *                                    usage-code union lists its literals), else its properties
 *                namespace           the names it re-exports
 *                function / variable empty: `type` already carries the signature
 *
 * WHY THE MEMBERS ARE SORTED. A diff has to be stable across runs, and declaration order in a
 * bundled `.d.ts` is the bundler's business, not the API's. The one thing sorting gives up is
 * overload ORDER on a function, which is why a function's overloads live in `type` (printed in
 * declaration order by the type printer) rather than in `members`.
 *
 * THE TYPESCRIPT VERSION IS PART OF THE BASELINE. Entries are produced by the TypeScript type
 * printer, so an upgrade can legitimately change the text without the API changing. The inventory
 * records the version it was derived under and this script refuses a silent mismatch: an upgrade
 * reds here and is regenerated deliberately, which is the same bargain `test/scripts/attw-gate.test.ts`
 * strikes with `attw`. Fully-qualified type names are deliberately NOT requested from the printer:
 * they embed the absolute path of the declarations file, which would make the baseline differ
 * between two machines that agree about the API.
 *
 * USAGE
 *
 *     tsx scripts/api-surface.ts [--declarations <path>] [--inventory <path>] [--write]
 *
 *   --declarations  the built `.d.ts` to read (default `dist/index.d.ts`, relative to cwd)
 *   --inventory     the committed inventory (default `release/public-api.json`, relative to cwd)
 *   --write         regenerate the inventory instead of comparing it
 *
 * EXIT CODES.  0 the surface matches (or was written).  1 the surface drifted.  2 the check could
 * not run: bad arguments, or inputs missing. 1 and 2 are kept apart because they need different
 * responses, and a run that could not read its inputs must never be mistaken for a clean one.
