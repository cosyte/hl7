Add `profiles.philips`, the seventh built-in vendor profile: Philips Vue PACS ("IS Link") imaging.

It declares the six Vue PACS custom Z-segments, one per filler role: `ZDS` (DICOM **Study Instance
UID**, an RP composite whose first component is the UID), `ZLK` (linked studies/orders), `ZAO` (order
additional details — modality, body part, transfer/acquisition status, technician + radiologist,
custom slots), `ZEB` (encrypted patient info), `ZAP` (patient additional details), and `ZAV` (visit
additional details). With the profile, a Vue PACS ORM/ADT feed parses without `UNKNOWN_SEGMENT`
warnings and each field resolves by name. Field positions are transcribed verbatim from the spec,
including its own gaps (`ZAO` has no field 7; `ZAP` has no field 2). Grounded in the publicly
published Vue PACS 12.2.8 HL7 Interface Specifications (Philips, doc HA1669 Rev A, §§5.11–5.16) — not
an invented quirk (ADR 0018). Vendor timestamps are HL7-native, so the profile adds no custom date
formats. The profile only *names* fields (so a consumer knows `ZEB` is PHI-bearing); it never decodes
or rewrites them. Ships two synthetic, PHI-scanned fixtures (`vendor-shapes/philips/orm-o01.hl7`,
`vendor-shapes/philips/adt-a08.hl7`). Additive only — existing profiles, warning codes, and the
parse/serialize surface are unchanged.
