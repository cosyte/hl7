/**
 * Tests for the CHANGELOG generation contract: `.changeset/config.json` plus the
 * shape of `CHANGELOG.md` that makes generated output land where a reader expects
 * it.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `CHANGELOG.md` is listed in `package.json#files`, so it is
 * inside every published tarball. For the whole of this package's published
 * history the release wrote no version heading into it, because
 * `.changeset/config.json` set `"changelog": false`, and the file was instead
 * hand-maintained under one `[Unreleased]` heading that nothing ever rolled over.
 * The published tarball therefore described its own contents as unreleased, and
 * its preamble said the first release "will ship" an API surface that had shipped
 * months earlier. That is not a typo to correct by hand: correcting the prose
 * leaves the mechanism that produced it, and it drifts again on the next release.
 *
 * WHAT EACH TEST PINS, AND WHY IT IS HERE:
 *
 *  1. The flag itself. `changelog` must name a generator that really resolves and
 *     really exports the two functions Changesets calls. `false` is a legal value
 *     that silently produces no version heading at all, which is the state this
 *     work replaced.
 *  2. THE DEFECT, ASSERTED DIRECTLY: no `[Unreleased]` heading and no
 *     `[Unreleased]` link definition survive in the file. With generation on, a
 *     surviving hand-maintained `[Unreleased]` heading is worse than before, not
 *     better: the generated version section is prepended ABOVE it, leaving already
 *     released content sitting under "Unreleased" forever.
 *  3. That the file is still shipped. If it ever leaves `files`, tests 2 and 4 are
 *     still nice-to-have but stop being about a consumer-visible defect, and the
 *     next reader deserves to be told which it is.
 *  4. END TO END, AGAINST THE REAL TOOL. The repo's real `CHANGELOG.md` and real
 *     `.changeset/config.json` are copied into a throwaway package, a synthetic
 *     changeset is added, and the real `changeset version` is run. A test that
 *     reimplements where Changesets inserts text proves only that the test agrees
 *     with itself, and would keep passing through the upgrade that moved it. The
 *     released document must satisfy the shape rule TOO, and the archived history
 *     must come through byte identical: a rule that only held before the first
 *     release would wedge this repo the first time this configuration worked.
 *  5. TWO CONSECUTIVE RELEASES, because one proves less than it looks like it
 *     does. The second release is where the sharp edge is: `## 0.0.9` is a
 *     SUBSTRING of the `## 0.0.10` that follows it, so any check written with
 *     `String.indexOf` or a substring `toContain` over a version heading passes on
 *     the first release and reds on the second, in a Version PR, with the changeset
 *     already consumed. Every version-heading comparison here is an exact match
 *     against the heading list for that reason.
 *  6. A CONTROL PROVING THE FLAG IS LOAD-BEARING. The same inputs with
 *     `"changelog": false` must produce NO version heading. Without this, test 4
 *     would pass on a config change that did nothing.
 *  7. THE SHAPE RULE, and the negative control that explains it. Changesets
 *     prepends by replacing the FIRST newline in the file, so exactly one line can
 *     sit above generated output. The rule is that NOTHING BUT THE H1 sits above
 *     the first heading, which is what makes the splice land between two headings
 *     instead of cutting a paragraph in half. It is deliberately not "the archive
 *     heading comes second": a release puts its own version heading there. The
 *     control reproduces the damage on the shape this file used to have, so the
 *     rule is demonstrated rather than asserted.
 *
 * Every case runs in a temp directory built from scratch, and every mutation
 * happens there: nothing here writes into the repo, bumps its version, or consumes
 * a real changeset. The temp tree links this repo's Prettier and Prettier config in
 * because Changesets reformats the whole document it writes and falls back to its
 * own bundled Prettier 2 when it finds none, which is not the formatter any release
 * of this package uses.
 *
 * MEASURED WHILE BUILDING THIS, AND WORTH KNOWING BEFORE DEBUGGING A RELEASE:
 * Changesets wraps the changelog write in a try/catch that only `console.warn`s.
 * A tree where `package.json` declares a Prettier config that cannot be resolved
 * bumps the version, consumes the changeset, and writes NO changelog at all, with
 * a warning as the only signal. Reproduced here on this repo's own inputs by
 * declaring `"prettier": "@cosyte/prettier-config"` with no `node_modules`: the
 * version went to `0.0.1` and `CHANGELOG.md` came back byte identical. Nothing in
 * this repo can prevent that (it is upstream, and it is why the temp trees below
 * link the config in rather than only naming it), but a release that publishes
 * with an unchanged changelog is that failure, not a config that quietly reverted.
 *
 * SECURITY: every subprocess call uses spawnSync with array args. No exec, no
 * shell-form.
